<h1> Pac-Xon </h1>
To open the file, go into the folder named <b> "Pacxon" </b>. Then, you can open the Pacxon.pde file in Processing and the program from there.

Pac-Xon is an old arcade game that is ca combination of Xenon and Pacman. We have slightly modified it to match some themes in Stuy.

<h3> How to Play </h3>
<p>Use the W,A,S, and D keys to move Thluffy SinClair around the field.The safe zone is the blue squares. Thluffy may freely wonder about this area. Thluffy will draw a path (the green squares) on uncharted area (the gray squares). If you have successfully made a path from one blue square to another square, then the area without a monster will fill. If there are monsters on both sides of the path, then only the path will turn into blue squares. However, if a monster hits your path before you make it to another blue square, then you will loose a life. The goal of the game is to fill up AT LEAST 80% of the field with blue squares. Once you have reached 80%, you will automatically advanced to the next level. Good Luck! May the odds be ever in your favor!

<h3> Bugs/ Improvements </h3>
<ul>
  <li>We are actually very proud of filling algorithum. We had started it during CodeDay about 2 weeks ago. There we realized the difficulty of the project. Kevin had took it upon himself to complete the task. He spent 2 weeks focusing on different algorithums to best solve the problem. He had started with a BFS but recently moved on to search closer to the behaviour of an a* search. The "fill" is long, and slightly laggy, but we are still very proud of it. That would be one of our main conerns if we were to continue on. <br>
  Currently, we cannot fill large spaces in under 3 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>The monster and path collision isn't working. Idealy, the moster would hit into the path and one by one the green squares would turn red, possibly costing the player a life. But we could not get this feautre to work. This is also another one of our main concerns
  </li>
  <li>Levels would also be a "next" step.</li>
  <li>Powerups would be a nice bonus.</li>
</ul>

<p> Overall, we are quite satisfied with what we have, given the time frame and circumstances in which we had to complete it.
